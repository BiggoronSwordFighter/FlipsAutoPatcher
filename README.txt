v1.2.2 
This is a third party tool extension for flips.exe that enabled auto patching for flips.exe. 
You can find the FlipsAutoPatcher-v1.2.2.EXE in "/dist/", copy the contents of the dist folder where ever you want.

Notes:
1. Added slightly better error handling.
2. User now has the option to choose ".IPS" files.
3. Scrollbar added to the "Info/Output:" box (GUI).
4. Neater line spacing.
5. Fixed small bugs.
6. New App Icon.

There are a few .BPS files inside the "/PATCHES/" folder if you want to take a look. 
To decode the patch files you'll need to find a ROM that matches this:
